# Snake Game in C

## Overview

This project implements the classic Snake game using the C programming language. The game features a simple terminal-based interface where the player controls a snake that grows as it eats food. The goal is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body while trying to consume as much food as possible.

## Features

- **Simple terminal-based interface**: Runs in the terminal, no graphical libraries required.
- **Basic gameplay**: Control the snake using keyboard inputs.
- **Growing snake**: The snake grows longer as it consumes food.
- **Collision detection**: Game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.

## Installation

To build and run the Snake game, you'll need a C compiler (like `gcc`) installed on your system. 

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oneHalfA/snake_in_c.git
   cd snake_in_c
   make
   ./exec
